  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>Last updated: August 7, 2025</p>

  <p>At Metaria Ry, we take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, store, and protect your information when you visit or interact with our website. We are committed to ensuring that your personal data is handled securely and in compliance with applicable laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other relevant privacy regulations.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We collect information to help us understand how users interact with our website and to improve your experience. The types of information we collect include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Anonymous Usage Data:</strong> Using Google Analytics, we collect aggregated and anonymous information such as pages visited, time spent on pages, browser type and version, operating system, device information, and approximate geographic location at the city level only.</li>
    <li><strong>Technical Data:</strong> Information about your device and connection, including IP address (anonymized by Google Analytics), browser user agent, and screen resolution.</li>
    <li><strong>Visitor Identification Data:</strong> To distinguish individual users, we generate a unique, randomly created identifier (visitor ID) which is stored locally in your browser's <code>localStorage</code>. This visitor ID does not contain any personal information and cannot be used to directly identify you.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Use of Cookies and Local Storage</h2>
  <p>Our website uses cookies and browser local storage technologies to collect information about your visit. Cookies are small text files stored on your device that help us remember your preferences and track usage.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Google Analytics Cookies:</strong> Google Analytics uses cookies to collect information on website usage to help us analyze traffic and improve our services. These cookies collect data such as session duration, page views, and user flow through the site. The IP addresses collected by Google Analytics are anonymized.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Visitor Identification via Local Storage:</strong> To better distinguish between unique visitors and improve analytical insights, we generate and store a unique visitor ID in your browser's local storage. This ID is randomly generated upon your first visit after you have consented to cookies and tracking. It is used solely for anonymous analytics purposes and is never linked to any personal data or shared with third parties.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Consent and Control:</strong> We do not set cookies or store visitor IDs until you have given explicit consent via our cookie banner or other consent mechanisms. You have the right to decline or withdraw consent at any time. You can also manage or delete cookies and local storage data directly via your browser settings.</p>

  <h2>3. How We Use the Information</h2>
  <p>The information collected through Google Analytics, cookies, and visitor IDs is used for the following purposes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To analyze website traffic and user behavior, enabling us to improve the usability, performance, and content of our website.</li>
    <li>To distinguish unique visitors and sessions, helping us better understand visitor engagement without collecting personal information.</li>
    <li>To ensure the security and integrity of our website and prevent fraudulent activity.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information or visitor ID with third parties for their marketing purposes.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Retention and Security</h2>
  <p>We retain anonymous analytics data and visitor identification data only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. Google Analytics data is retained according to Google's data retention policies.</p>
  
  <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard your data against unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. However, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

  <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the following rights regarding your personal data:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Access:</strong> You can request access to the data we hold about you.</li>
    <li><strong>Correction:</strong> You can request correction of any inaccurate or incomplete data.</li>
    <li><strong>Erasure:</strong> You can request deletion of your personal data, subject to legal obligations.</li>
    <li><strong>Restriction:</strong> You may request restriction of processing your data.</li>
    <li><strong>Objection:</strong> You can object to the processing of your data for marketing or analytics purposes.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Portability:</strong> Where applicable, you have the right to receive your data in a structured, machine-readable format.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Please note that since the visitor ID generated and stored in localStorage is anonymous and not personally identifiable, these rights may have limited application in that context.</p>

  <h2>6. Managing Cookies and Visitor IDs</h2>
  <p>You can manage your cookie preferences and visitor identification data as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the cookie consent banner presented upon your first visit to accept or decline cookies.</li>
    <li>Manage or disable cookies via your browser settings. Refer to your browser’s help documentation for instructions.</li>
    <li>Clear your browser's <code>localStorage</code> to remove the stored visitor ID.</li>
    <li>Opt out of Google Analytics tracking by installing the official <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google LLC. Google Analytics collects and processes data according to its own Privacy Policy, available at <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or applicable laws. We encourage you to review this page periodically. The “Last updated” date at the top indicates when this policy was last revised.</p>
